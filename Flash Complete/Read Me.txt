This code demonstrates how to use macromedia flash files in vb6...this is means that with it you can send the player flash values...I've done this here with setting the value of a variable which was 
declaired and used in the ".fla" file from within the vb programme,and flash player can also send values to your vb programme.You'll have to use the Shockwave Flash Component...and set the "Allow Action Script" to "alwaya" which is the default value i think...In this example have a flash file...when you click the "Walk" button the vb programme tells the flash player to move thae character...and when the character reaches the "Finish" thingy  the flash player tells vb that so...
Its my first submission here,and i've seen something like this here, but they were all just examples of how to use flash files in vb and thats all...whereas this examples tells how to use the action script of the flash file from vb6.This a part of an another project which i'm doin'...and being a beignner I find ths quiet usefull! :)....SPACIAL THANX TO THE isButton..which i'm using in this programme..ITS AWSOME!..if u don't have downloaded it already then please do so from this site...this gives you programme very cool look ;)
I' couldn't include the ".fla" file  with the zip archive but this is te Action Script I've used...if you'r familer with flash then this should be easy...

Paste This Code On The First Frame
walk=a Movie Clip...The Walkin Character
fin= A Movie Clip...The Finish Thing At The Bottom

var Move;
Move=0
_root.onEnterFrame = function() {
	if(Move==1)
		{
		walk._y=walk._y+2;
		}
		if(_root.walk.hittest(_root.fin))
				fscommand("fin", "true");
}
